# Information Management Project

## Note

This branch is for testing purposes, including development of the database, application, and for [cloud deployment tests](https://ncsc-db.streamlit.app/).
This branch also utilizes sqlite instead of mysql compared to the other branches.

## Overview

We made a senior citizen database application that can do the basic CRUD operations.The application is based on the National Commission of Senior Citizens (NCSC) information form.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment using `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux.
4. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the application using `streamlit run main.py`, and your browser should open automatically.
